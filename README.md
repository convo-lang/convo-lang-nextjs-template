This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`convo --create-next-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@convo-lang/convo-lang-cli).

## Getting Started

First, add your OpenAI API key to `.env.development`

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `template` prop of the `ConvoView` defines the behavior of the agent.

## Project Structure
- `convo-generated/` - Stores file generated by the Convo-Lang CLI for synchronizing types between TypeScript and Convo-Lang
- `components/ConvoView.tsx` - A Wrapper around the Convo-Lang React ConversationView that auto imports generated types and components
- `pages/api/convo-lang/[...convo-api-action].ts` - Convo-Lang backend api routes

## Type Synchronization
Types and components can be synchronized with Convo-Lang by using the `@convoStruct` and `@convoComponent` JSDoc tags.

Apply `@convoStruct` to types and interfaces you would like to use in Convo-Lang and apply `@convoComponent`
to components you would like to be rendered in the ConvoView

When the dev command is ran both the next dev server and convo-lang sync server are started. The
Convo-Lang sync server will automatically synchronize types between TypeScript and Convo-Lang
as changes to the project are made.
